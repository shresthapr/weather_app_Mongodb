As you receive a response from the OpenWeatherAPI to your backend, create a timestamp, save your API response, user â€˜s query input, together with the timestamp as a Document to MongoDB. Future API calls to your backend from now on will no instantly trigger an API call to OpenWeatherAPI, if an API response for the same geolocation has been made recently (less than 10 minutes ago), only return the saved response from the MongoDB. If it is too old (timestamp indicates it was created more than 10 minutes ago), go ahead and make a new API call, renew the saved response.
